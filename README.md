This contains some RMDs where I wrangled the data to get some information/create some figures for the TMMP report. 


1. TMMP Forest Type Plot.RMD
The excel file TMMP Living Dead by forest type is pulled from a table in the report into excel, I pulled it to get the info to make a quick bar plot showing the number of living and dead trees by forest type across the two sample years to help visualize things that were shown in a table. 

2.TMMP Adult Tree Metrics.RMD
This is using the tree measurement data, prior to uploading the data I changed the qualifier DY to A in excel 
This RMD is just restructuring the data to look at the number of trees alive/dead by species, site and sample year

3. Propagule Table
   This is using the regen data to generate a table showing the mean/sem number of props at each site each sample year broken by species
